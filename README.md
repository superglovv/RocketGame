# "Rocket vs Asteroids" Game

## Introduction

This project represents a simple arcade-style game in which the player controls a rocket to avoid asteroids and shoot them with projectiles. The game is built using an LED matrix for display, a joystick for control, and a button for shooting and starting the game, while an LCD screen will display the menu.
The purpose of the project is to combine entertainment with practical learning in electronics and embedded programming. The inspiration for this project comes from classic arcade games that provide a simple yet captivating experience. This idea reminds me of the time when, as a child, I borrowed my mom's phone to relax and play 'Rocket vs Asteroids' for a few minutes.
Nowadays, there are many enthusiasts of retro games, as well as new consoles and arcade machines (Arcade Cabinets) that emulate the retro gaming experience. For me, building this project is a useful way to better understand robotics concepts.
